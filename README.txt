Auction House
Implemented all features and the bonus features analog clock and ability to add auction items during a session.

Important
all auction item info stored in XML files (WITHOUT SCHEMA) therefore if you change the document the program will not have auction items. Second you might have to change the image paths in the document to reflect the paths in your system. Third when you add an auction item during program execution it is only available during that session, IT IS NOT PERSISTED. Also when adding an image to the new auction item it will only accept .png files.
